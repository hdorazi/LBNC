'Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I've got the basics.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So you've stopped having funny dreams?' said Hermione sceptically.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Pretty much,' said Harry, not looking at her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I don't think Snape should stop until you're absolutely sure you can control them!' said Hermione indignantly. 'Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry forcefully. 'Just drop it, Hermione, OK?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it; ii. was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How can that come as a shock?' Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron's timetable with her wand so that il flashed a different colour according to its subject.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron, 'there's been a lot going on.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, there you are,' she said, handing him his timetable, 'if you follow that you should do fine.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You've given me an evening off every week!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That's for Quidditch practice,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The smile faded from Ron's face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's the point?' he said dully. 'We've got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad's got of becoming Minister for Magic.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione said nothing; she was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's wrong, Harry?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' he said quickly. 'Nothing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione's chair.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I saw Cho earlier,' said Hermione tentatively. 'She looked really miserable, too . . . have you two had a row again?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Wha- oh, yeah, we have,' said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What about?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well, I don't blame you!' said Ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable. 'If it hadn't been for her . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful; all he had to do was look angry, nod and say 'Yeah' and That's right' whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character. Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry's head . . . he was as bad, wasn't he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it . . . not unless they really loathed them . . . perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands: but hadn't Lily asked, 'What's he done to you?' And hadn't James replied, 'It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.' Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius . . . but in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, revising, traipsing back and forth to the library. Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, I'm talking to you, can you hear me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Huh?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked round. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was late on Sunday evening: Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to revise Ancient Runes, and Ron had Quidditch practice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, hi,' said Harry, pulling his books towards him. 'How come you're not at practice?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's over,' said Ginny. 'Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we're not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with\\u00a0 \\u00a0 his own bat.' She sighed heavily. 'Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it's only just got through Umbridge's new screening process.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re-wrapped. There was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading: Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's Easter eggs from Mum,' said Ginny. There's one for you . . . there you go.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a lump rise in his throat.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you OK, Harry?' Ginny asked quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, I'm fine,' said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You seem really down lately,' Ginny persisted. 'You know, I'm sure if you just talked to Cho . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's not Cho I want to talk to,' said Harry brusquely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Who is it, then?' asked Ginny, watching him closely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile cf books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I wish I could talk to Sirius,' he muttered. 'But I know I can't.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully. More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Come on,' said Harry dully. 'With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate - '- Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with Dementors - or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh damn,' whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. 'I forgot - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Madam Pince was swooping down on them, her shrivelled face contorted with rage.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Chocolate in the library!' she screamed. 'Out - out - OUT!' And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry's books, bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran.*As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which read:CAREERS ADVICEAll fifth-years are required to attend a short meeting with theirHead of House during the first week of the summer term to discusstheir future careers. Times of individual appointments are listed below.Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth-years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I don't fancy Healing,' said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St Mungo's on its front. 'It says here you need at least \\\\E\\\\\\\" at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey . . . don't want much, do they?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it?' said Hermione absently.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, 'SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS?' 'You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly. 'Good sense of when to duck, more like.' He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. 'Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad . . . They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: 'HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hey,' said a voice in Harry's ear. He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them. 'Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor. 'She says you need to talk to Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up 'MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah . . .' said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. 'With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling. 'It's a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?' continued Fred. 'No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we'd have messed up people's revision, too, which would be the very last thing we'd want to do.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But it's business as usual from tomorrow,' Fred continued briskly. 'And if we're going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are - you - insane?' said Hermione in a hushed voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And how are you going to get in there in the first place?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was ready for this question.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sirius's knife,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Excuse me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry. 'So even if she's bewitched the door so Alahomora won't work, which I bet she has - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What do you think about this?' Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. 'If Harry wants to do it, it's up to him, isn't it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. 'Right, then. We're thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact ii everybody's in the corridors - Harry, we'll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office - I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?' he said, looking at George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Easy,' said George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What sort of diversion is it?' asked Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again. 'At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy's corridor round about five o'clock tomorrow.'*Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his fathers behaviour . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Something caught Harry's attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal tc stoking the fire.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead. Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o'clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in\\u00a0 \\u00a0 History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 '. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she'll be able to guess you've been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she'll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You take notes for a change, it won't kill you!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow oi dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an 'E'.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Whoops,' he said softly. 'Another zero, then, Potter.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm sorry!' said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. I'm really sorry, Harry. I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn't in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sorry, Professor,' he panted, as he closed the door. 'I forgot.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No matter, Potter,' she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall. 'Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - ' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes?' Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?' she went on, talking a little louder than before.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry. 'Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply. 'I would also advise -'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging \\\\\\\"Acceptable\\\\\\\" at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,' she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. 'Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \\\\\\\"Outstanding\\\\\\\" in their OWLs, so - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?' Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. 'I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I was just wondering whether Mr Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?' said Professor Umbridge sweetly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Were you?' said Professor McGonagall haughtily. 'Well, Potter,' she continued, as though there had been no interruption, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \\\\\\\"Acceptable\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you - are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,' simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. 'I was just concerned that you might not have Harry's most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I'm quite sure I slipped in a note.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What, this thing?' said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Did you not understand my note, Minerva?' asked Professor Umbndge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, then, I am confused . . . I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr Potter false hope that - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'False hope?' repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. 'He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I should have made my meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. 'He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Any questions, Potter?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry. 'What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence. It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 'that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 '- unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!' said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!' shouted Professor McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Aha! shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall. 'Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That's what you want, isn't it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. Totter, that concludes our careers consultation.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to 'Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'. 'Umbridge looks like she's in a really bad mood already . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him . . . there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve . . . nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach . . . and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But the fact remained that if he was caught . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!' whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Umbridge. 'And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 You're less like your father than I thought . . . the risk would've been what made it fun for James . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But did he want to be like his father any more?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, don't do it, please don't do it!' Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He did not answer; he did not know what to do.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, 'Give it a rest, OK? He can make up his own mind.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry - please!' Hermione pleaded weakly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded at once into emerald green flames.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!' Harry said loudly and clearly\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced. He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around ir. the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretchec over the country. This time, his knees remained firm upon the cole floor of Umbridge's office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, bu. Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry!' he said, looking thoroughly shocked. 'What are you - 'what's happened, is everything all right?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry. 'I just wondered - I mean, I just fancied a - 'a chat with Sirius.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'll call him,' said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, 'he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge's hard stone floor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What is it?' said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level. Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. 'Are you all right? Do you need help?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry, 'it's nothing like that . . . I just wanted to talk . . . about my dad.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, 'I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm fifteen' said Harry heatedly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, 'James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be - he was popular, he was good at Quidditch - good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts, and James - whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry - always hated the Dark Arts.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because - well, just because you said you were bored,' he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not proud of it,' said Sirius quickly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, 'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin smiled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius and Lupin laughed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'd forgotten he used to do that,' said Sirius affectionately.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Was he playing with the Snitch?' said Lupin eagerly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently. 'Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an idiot.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course he was a bit of an idiot!' said Sirius bracingly, 'we were all idiots! Well - not Moony so much,' he said fairly, looking at Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Lupin shook his head. 'Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?' he said. 'Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well,' said Sirius, 'you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes . . . that was something . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And,' said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, 'he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,' said Sirius, shrugging, 'he couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How come she married him?' Harry asked miserably. 'She hated him!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nah, she didn't,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She started going out with him in seventh year,' said Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Once James had deflated his head a bit,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,' said Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Even Snape?' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Lupin slowly, 'Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And my mum was OK with that?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,' said Sirius. 'I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look,' he said, 'your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, OK,' said Harry heavily. 'I just never thought I'd feel sorry for Snape.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Now you mention it,' said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, 'how did Snape react when he found you'd seen all this?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He told me he'd never teach me Occlumency again,' said Harry indifferently, 'like that's a big disappoint-\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He WHAT?' shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you serious, Harry?' said Lupin quickly. 'He's stopped giving you lessons?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction. 'But it's OK, I don't care, it's a bit of a relief to tell you the - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm coming up there to have a word with Snape!' said Sirius forcefully, and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back down again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If anyone's going to tell Snape it will be me!' he said firmly. 'But Harry, first of all, you're to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons - when Dumbledore hears - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I can't tell him that, he'd kill me!' said Harry, outraged. 'You didn't see him when we got out of the Pensieve.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!' said Lupin sternly. 'Do you understand me? Nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'OK, OK,' said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. 'I'll . . . I'll try and say something to him . . . but it won't be - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Sirius, glancing behind him. 'It must be somebody your end.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's heart skipped several beats.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'd better go!' he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge's fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Quickly, quickly!' he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. 'Ah, she's left it open - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it at last . . . they've had it coming to them for years . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 One landing down from Umbridge's office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So!' said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing\\u00a0 \\u00a0 just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. 'So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. 'I've got the form and I've got the whips waiting . . . oh, let me do it now . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very good, Argus,' she said. 'You two,' she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, 'are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know what?' said Fred. 'I don't think we are.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He turned to his twin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?' asked Fred.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Definitely,' said George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Accio brooms!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley - Weasley' Wizarding Wheezes,' he said in a loud voice. 'Our new premises!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,' added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'STOP THEM!' shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Give her hell from us, Peeves.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0\\u201cSo Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?\\\\\\u00a0\\\\\\\"If you ask. that once more,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"I'm going to stick this sprout \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm only checking!\\\\\\\" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow's kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, Snape was offering to help him!\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"He said he'd promised Malfoy's mother to protect him, that he'd made an Un-breakable Oath or something \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"An Unbreakable Vow?\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking stunned. \\\\\\\"Nah, he can't have. . . . Are you sure?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, I'm sure,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Why, what does it mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\u201cWell, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You die,\\\\\\\" said Ron simply. \\\\\\\"Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\\\\\\\" said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \\\\\\\"Only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left but-tock has never been the same since.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, well, passing over Fred's left buttock \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I beg your pardon?\\\\\\\" said Fred's voice as the twins entered the kitchen.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Aaah, George, look at this. They're using knives and everything. Bless them.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'll be seventeen in two and a bit months' time,\\\\\\\" said Ron grumpily, \\\\\\\"and then I'll be able to do it by magic!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But meanwhile,\\\\\\\" said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, \\\\\\\"we can enjoy watching you demon-strate the correct use of a \\u2014 whoops-a-daisy!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You made me do that!\\\\\\\" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. \\\\\\\"You wait, when I'm seventeen \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\\\\\\\" yawned Fred.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\\\\\\\" said George, \\\\\\\"what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called \\u2014 unless our information is faulty \\u2014 Lavender Brown?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. \\\\\\\"Mind your own business.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What a snappy retort,\\\\\\\" said Fred. \\\\\\\"I really don't know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What d'you mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Did she have an accident or something?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" ..|;\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Care-ful, now!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand,\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Ron!\\\\\\\" she said furiously. \\\\\\\"Don't you ever let me see you throw-ing knives again!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I wont,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"let you see,\\\\\\\" he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fred, George, I'm sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.\\\\\\\" ;\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No problem,\\\\\\\" said George.\\u00a0- \\\\\\\"Then, as Charlie isn't coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;|/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny \\u2014\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\u2014 that'll make Ginny's Christmas \\u2014\\\\\\\" muttered Fred. \\\\\\\"\\u2014 everyone should be comfortable. Well, they'll have a bed, anyway,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?\\\\\\\" asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. \\\\\\\"No, he's busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Or he's the world's biggest prat,\\\\\\\" said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. \\\\\\\"One of the two. \\\\\\\"Well, let's get going, then, George.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What are you two up to?\\\\\\\" asked Ron. \\\\\\\"Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we'll be free\\u00a0too!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I don't think we can do that,\\\\\\\" said Fred seriously. \\\\\\\"It's very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs \\u2014\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\u2014 and if you want people to help you, Ron,\\\\\\\" added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, \\\\\\\"I wouldn't chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . , almost like real magic. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Gits,\\\\\\\" said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \\\\\\\"Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I couldn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \\\\\\\"Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yep,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I'm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore\\u2019s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pity you didn't hear what Malfoy\\u2019s actually doing, though.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I couldn't have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \\\\\\\" 'Course, you know what they'll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They'll say Snape isn't really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy's up to.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They didn't hear him,\\\\\\\" said Harry flatly. \\\\\\\"No one's that good an actor, not even Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah . . . I'm just saying, though/' said Ron.\\u00a0Harry turned to face him, frowning. \\\\\\\"You think I'm right, though?\\\\\\\" ,\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I do!\\\\\\\" said Ron hastily. \\\\\\\"Seriously, I do! But they're all convinced Snape's in the Order, aren't they?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. . . .\\u00a0This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.\\u00a0Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \\\\\\\"I told you so,\\\\\\\" which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already.\\u00a0Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.\\u00a0They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called \\\\\\\"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\\\\\\\" Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice.\\u00a0Oh, come and stir my cauldron,\\u00a0And if you do it right,\\u00a0I'll boil you up some hot strong love\\u00a0To keep you warm tonight.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"We danced to this when we were eighteen!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \\\\\\\"Do you remember, Arthur?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Mphf?\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \\\\\\\"Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sorry about this,\\\\\\\" he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \\\\\\\"Be over soon.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No problem,\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning. \\\\\\\"Has it been busy at the Ministry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Very,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater \\u2014 only don't repeat that, Harry,\\\\\\\" he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They're not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\\\\\\\" asked Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm afraid so,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"I know Dumbledore's tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'. . . but again, this is\\u00a0all top secret. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I won't say anything,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \\\\\\\"You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I checked, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley at once. \\\\\\\"I went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between\\u00a0Malfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin's head turn a lit-tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina's crooning.\\u00a0Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It's left me for a spell...\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Has it occurred to you, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley, \\\\\\\"that Snape was simply pretending \\u2014 ?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy's up to?\\\\\\\" said Harry quickly. \\\\\\\"Yeah, I thought you'd say that. But how do we know?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It isn't our business to know,\\\\\\\" said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"It's Dumbledore\\u2019s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"just say \\u2014 just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore\\u2019s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But Dumbledore can make mistakes,\\\\\\\" argued Harry. \\\\\\\"He says it himself. And you\\\\\\\" \\u2014 he looked Lupin straight in the eye \\u2014 \\\\\\\"do you honestly like Snape?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I neither like nor dislike Severus,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,\\\\\\\" he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expres-sion. \\\\\\\"We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-pened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-ally do at the full moon.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But he 'accidentally' let it slip that you're a werewolf, so you had to leave!\\\\\\\" said Harry angrily.\\u00a0Lupin shrugged. \\\\\\\"The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Maybe he didn't dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You are determined to hate him, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Lupin with a faint smile. \\\\\\\"And I understand; with James as your father, with Sir-ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore's orders that Severus questioned Draco.\\\\\\\" ;\\u00a0. . . and now you've torn it quite apart I'll thank you to give back my heart!\\u00a0Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Eez eet over?\\\\\\\" said Fleur loudly. \\\\\\\"Thank goodness, what an 'orrible \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Shall we have a nightcap, then?\\\\\\\" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. \\\\\\\"Who wants eggnog?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What have you been up to lately?\\\\\\\" Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, I've been underground,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\\\\\\\" -:\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I've been living among my fellows, my equals,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Werewolves,\\\\\\\" he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. \\\\\\\"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \\\\\\\"I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing \\u2014 and sometimes killing \\u2014 to eat.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How come they like Voldemort?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Who's Greyback?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You haven't heard of him?\\\\\\\" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. \\\\\\\"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin paused and then said, \\\\\\\"It was Greyback who bit me.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry, astonished. \\\\\\\"When \\u2014 when you were a kid, you mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"But you are normal!\\\\\\\" said Harry fiercely. \\\\\\\"You've just got a \\u2014 a\\u00a0problem \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin burst out laughing. \\\\\\\"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved\\u00a0rabbit.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"The Half-Blood what?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Prince,\\\\\\\" said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"There are no Wizarding princes,\\\\\\\" said Lupin, now smiling. \\\\\\\"Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the Chosen One' would be enough.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It's nothing to do with me!\\\\\\\" said Harry indignantly. \\\\\\\"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Lupin reminiscently. \\\\\\\"There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"My dad used it,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\"but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\\\\\\\" Harry persisted.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Not necessarily,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He looked into Harry's face and then said quietly, \\\\\\\"James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 'Prince.'\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Abandoning pretense, Harry said, \\\\\\\"And it wasn't Sirius? Or you?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Definitely not.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh.\\\\\\\" Harry stared into the fire. \\\\\\\"I just thought \\u2014 well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How old is this book, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I dunno, I've never checked.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Lupin.\\u00a0Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \\\\\\\"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\\\\\\\" which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\\u00a0Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father's friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .\\u00a0\\\\\\\"She's got to be joking. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-peared to be a thick gold chain.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What's chat?\\\\\\\" asked Harry. '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Its from Lavender,\\\\\\\" said Ron, sounding revolted^ \\\\\\\"She earn\\u00a0honestly think I'd wear ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan\\u00a0gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u201cMy sweetheart\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Nice,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"If you tell them,\\\\\\\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \\\\\\\"I \\u2014 I \\u2014 I\\u2019ll \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Stutter at me?\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning. \\\\\\\"Come on, would I?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?\\\\\\\" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, think back,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well... we don't really talk much,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"It's mainly . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Snogging,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \\\\\\\"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I dunno,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\\u00a0Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher,\\u00a0Harry stared at it. \\\\\\\"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\\\\\\\" he asked. \\\\\\\"Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry,\\\\\\\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\\\\\\\" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hermione would,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. \\\\\\\"Nice,\\\\\\\" said Ron, roaring with laughter. \\\\\\\"Very thoughtful.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I'd rather have them than that necklace,\\\\\\\" said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.\\u00a0Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?\\\\\\\" .: \\\\\\\"Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks,\\\\\\\" said George, waving an airy hand. \\\\\\\"Parsnips, Remus?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,\\\\\\\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"'Ow 'orrible,\\\\\\\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, isn't it?\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Gravy, Fleur?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\\\\\\\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \\\\\\\"She is always knocking \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \\\\\\\"But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hmmm,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley. \\\\\\\"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Tonks's Patronus has changed its form,\\\\\\\" he told him. \\\\\\\"Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \\\\\\\"Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up-heaval ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It looked big, and it had four legs,\\\\\\\" said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. \\\\\\\"Hey ... it couldn't be \\u2014 ?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Arthur!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \\\\\\\"Arthur \\u2014 it's Percy!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Arthur, he's \\u2014 he's with the Minister!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy's wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.\\u00a0There was a moment's painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \\\\\\\"Merry Christmas, Mother.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, Percy!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\\u00a0Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You must forgive this intrusion,\\\\\\\" he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \\\\\\\"Percy and I were in the vicinity \\u2014 working, you know \\u2014 and he couldn't re-sist dropping in and seeing you all.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\\\\\\\" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. ... 1 '. mean \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, no, my dear Molly,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. \\\\\\\"I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Percy hadn't wanted to see you all so badly. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, Perce!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry into the silence.\\u00a0He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour's talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It's fine,\\\\\\\" he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. \\\\\\\"Fine,\\\\\\\" he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Wonderful!\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass\\u00a0through the door ahead of him. \\\\\\\"We'll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I'll be off. Carry on, everyone!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Charming,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \\\\\\\"Charming.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \\\\\\\"Did you know that?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry truthfully. |!.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. \\\\\\\"Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry ...\\\\\\\":\\u00a0He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, \\\\\\\"I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has \\u2014 most under-standably, as I say \\u2014 prevented this.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Still, Harry said nothing, waiting.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"The rumors that have flown around!\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. \\\\\\\"Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being 'the Chosen One'. . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here.\\u00a0\\u201cI assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\\\\\\\",\\u00a0Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, we've discussed it.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Have you, have you . . .\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \\\\\\\"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sorry, but that's between us,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \\\\\\\"Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge . . . no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Chosen One' or not?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. \\\\\\\"I don't really know what you mean, Minister.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour with a laugh. \\\\\\\"But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"People believe you are 'the Chosen One,' you see,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour. \\\\\\\"They think you quite the hero \\u2014 which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\\\\\\\" he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \\\\\\\"the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \\u2014 well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can't help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \\\\\\\"Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I don't exactly understand what you want,\\\\\\\" said Harry slowly. '\\\\\\\"Stand alongside the Ministry' . . . What does that mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour. \\\\\\\"If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"So basically,\\\\\\\" he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \\\\\\\"you'd like to give the impression that I'm working for the Ministry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-toned on so quickly. \\\\\\\"'The Chosen One,' you know. . . It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-pening. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\\\\\\\" said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \\\\\\\"won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \\\\\\\"well, yes, that's partly why we'd like \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I don't think that'll work,\\\\\\\" said Harry pleasantly. \\\\\\\"You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-ened instantly. \\\\\\\"I would not expect you to understand,\\\\\\\" he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \\\\\\\"These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, \\\\\\\"I see. You prefer \\u2014 like your hero, Dumbledore \\u2014 to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I don't want to be used,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\\\\\\\" said Harry, his temper rising now. \\\\\\\"You're doing what Barty Crouch\\u00a0did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' work-ing for you!\\\\\\\" ' i\\u00a0\\\\\\\"So you're not 'the Chosen One'?\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I thought you said it didn't matter either way?\\\\\\\" said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \\\\\\\"Not to you anyway.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I shouldn't have said that,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour quickly. \\\\\\\"It was tactless \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, it was honest,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister....\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What is Dumbledore up to?\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour brusquely. \\\\\\\"Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No idea,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, \\\\\\\"would you?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, 1 wouldn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You can try,\\\\\\\" said Harry indifferently. \\\\\\\"But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore\\u2019s still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0There was a long pause.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, \\\\\\\"Dumbledore\\u2019s man through and through, aren't you, Potter?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I am,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Glad we straightened that out.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house.\\\"\",\n          \"The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.\\\\News?\\\\\\\" asked the taller of the two.\\\\\\\"The best,\\\\\\\" replied Severus Snape.The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.\\\\\\\"Thought I might be late,\\\\\\\" said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \\\\\\\"It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?\\\\\\\"Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of imposing wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal was smoke.The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion's head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.\\\\\\\"He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks ...\\\\\\\" Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room's usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.\\\\\\\"Yaxley. Snape,\\\\\\\" said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \\\\\\\"You are very nearly late.\\\\\\\"The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.\\\\\\\"Severus, here,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. \\\\\\\"Yaxley \\u00a8C beside Dolohov.\\\\\\\"The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.\\\\\\\"So?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\\\\\\\"The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.\\\\\\\"Saturday ... at nightfall,\\\\\\\" repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape's black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort's face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort's lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.\\\\\\\"Good. Very good. And this information comes \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" \\u00a8C from the source we discussed,\\\\\\\" said Snape.\\\\\\\"My Lord.\\\\\\\"Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him.\\\\\\\"My Lord, I have heard differently.\\\\\\\"Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, \\\\\\\"Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.\\\\\\\"Snape was smiling.\\\\\\\"My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\\\\\\\" said Yaxley.\\\\\\\"If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,\\\\\\\" said Snape. \\\\\\\"I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"The Order's got one thing right, then, eh?\\\\\\\" said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.\\\\\\\"My Lord,\\\\\\\" Yaxley went on, \\\\\\\"Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.\\\\\\\"Where are they going to hide the boy next?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"At the home of one of the Order,\\\\\\\" said Snape. \\\\\\\"The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Well, Yaxley?\\\\\\\" Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. \\\\\\\"Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?\\\\\\\"Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.\\\\\\\"My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have \\u00a8C with difficulty, and after great effort \\u00a8C succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.\\\\\\\"Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.\\\\\\\"It is a start,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort. \\\\\\\"But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister's life will set me back a long way.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yes \\u00a8C my Lord, that is true \\u00a8C but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort. \\\\\\\"At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"We are at an advantage there, my Lord,\\\\\\\" said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. \\\\\\\"We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He will not do either,\\\\\\\" said Snape. \\\\\\\"The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"All the better,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort. \\\\\\\"He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.\\\\\\\"Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, \\\\\\\"I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.\\\\\\\"The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter's continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.\\\\\\\"I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.\\\\\\\"At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet.\\\\\\\"Wormtail,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, \\\\\\\"have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yes, m-my Lord,\\\\\\\" gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair that it appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.\\\\\\\"As I was saying,\\\\\\\" continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, \\\\\\\"I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.\\\\\\\"The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.\\\\\\\"No volunteers?\\\\\\\" said Voldemort. \\\\\\\"Let's see ... Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.\\\\\\\"Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.\\\\\\\"My Lord?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I ...\\\\\\\"Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.\\\\\\\"What is it?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Elm, my Lord,\\\\\\\" whispered Malfoy.\\\\\\\"And the core?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Dragon \\u00a8C dragon heartstring.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Good,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort. He drew out his wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort's wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.\\\\\\\"Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?\\\\\\\"Some of the throng sniggered.\\\\\\\"I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late ... What is it about my presence in your home that displaces you, Lucius?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Nothing \\u00a8C nothing, my Lord!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Such lies Lucius ... \\\\\\\"The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table.The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort's chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort's shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man's thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.\\\\\\\"Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Of course, my Lord,\\\\\\\" said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. \\\\\\\"We did desire it \\u00a8C we do.\\\\\\\"To Malfoy's left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact.\\\\\\\"My Lord,\\\\\\\" said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, \\\\\\\"it is an honor to have you here, in our family's house. There can be no higher pleasure.\\\\\\\"She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness.\\\\\\\"No higher pleasure,\\\\\\\" repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. \\\\\\\"That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.\\\\\\\"Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.\\\\\\\"My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?\\\\\\\"She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.\\\\\\\"I don't know what you mean, my Lord.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I'm talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.\\\\\\\"There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The giant snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys' humiliation. Bellatrix's face, so recently flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.\\\\\\\"She is no niece of ours, my Lord,\\\\\\\" she cried over the outpouring of mirth. \\\\\\\"We \\u00a8C Narcissa and I \\u00a8C have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What say you, Draco?\\\\\\\" asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. \\\\\\\"Will you babysit the cubs?\\\\\\\"The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother's eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.\\\\\\\"Enough,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. \\\\\\\"Enough.\\\\\\\"And the laughter died at once.\\\\\\\"Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,\\\\\\\" he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring, \\\\\\\"You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yes, my Lord,\\\\\\\" whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. \\\\\\\"At the first chance!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You shall have it,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort. \\\\\\\"And in your family, so in the world ... we shall cut away the cancer that infects us until only those of the true blood remain ...\\\\\\\"Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy's wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds.\\\\\\\"Do you recognize our guest, Severus?\\\\\\\" asked Voldemort.Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, \\\\\\\"Severus! Help me!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Ah, yes,\\\\\\\" said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.\\\\\\\"And you, Draco?\\\\\\\" asked Voldemort, stroking the snake's snout with his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore.\\\\\\\"But you would not have taken her classes,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort. \\\\\\\"For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\\\\\\"There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.\\\\\\\"Yes ... Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles ... how they are not so different from us ...\\\\\\\"One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again.\\\\\\\"Severus ... please ... please ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Silence,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy's wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. \\\\\\\"Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance ... She would have us all mate with Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves ...\\\\\\\"Nobody laughed this time. There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort's voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him again.\\\\\\\"Avada Kedavra\\\\\\\"The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor.\\\\\\\"Dinner, Nagini,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.\\u00a0\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          7,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCountText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCloudText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCount\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1550,\n        \"min\": 1552,\n        \"max\": 8928,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 197,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7237,\n          4282,\n          6450\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.  There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.  The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \\\\\\\"GOT YOUR CONK!\\\\\\\"  Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.  Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.  And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.  They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.  Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old  indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.  Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.  Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.  \\\\\\\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\\\\\\\"  Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.  The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.  Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.  Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.  \\\\\\\"What have we got today?\\\\\\\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.  \\\\\\\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \\\\\\\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.  Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.  Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:  Dear Harry,  I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?  I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.  Hagrid  Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.  It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.  At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.  Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.  Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.  \\\\\\\"Ah, Yes,\\\\\\\" he said softly, \\\\\\\"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\\\\\\\"  Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.  \\\\\\\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\\\\\\\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \\\\\\\"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\\\\\\\"  More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.  \\\\\\\"Potter!\\\\\\\" said Snape suddenly. \\\\\\\"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\\\\\\\"  Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.  \\\\\\\"I don't know, sit,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  Snape's lips curled into a sneer.  \\\\\\\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything.\\\\\\\"  He ignored Hermione's hand.  \\\\\\\"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\\\\\\\"  Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.  \\\\\\\"I don't know, sit.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\\\\\\\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?  Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.  \\\\\\\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\\\\\\\"  At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.  \\\\\\\"I don't know,\\\\\\\" said Harry quietly. \\\\\\\"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?\\\\\\\"  A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.  \\\\\\\"Sit down,\\\\\\\" he snapped at Hermione. \\\\\\\"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?\\\\\\\"  There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \\\\\\\"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\\\\\\\"  Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.  \\\\\\\"Idiot boy!\\\\\\\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \\\\\\\"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\\\\\\\"  Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.  \\\\\\\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\\\\\\\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.  \\\\\\\"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.\\\\\\\"  This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.  \\\\\\\"Doi* push it,\\\\\\\" he muttered, \\\\\\\"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.\\\\\\\"  As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \\\\\\\"Cheer up,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\\\\\\\"  At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.  When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \\\\\\\"Back, Fang -- back.\\\\\\\"  Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.  \\\\\\\"Hang on,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Back, Fang.\\\\\\\"  He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.  There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.  \\\\\\\"Make yerselves at home,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.  \\\\\\\"This is Ron,\\\\\\\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.  \\\\\\\"Another Weasley, eh?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\\\\\\\"  The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.  Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \\\\\\\"that old git.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\\\\\\\"  Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.  \\\\\\\"But he seemed to really hate me.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Rubbish!\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"Why should he?\\\\\\\"  Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.  \\\\\\\"How's yer brother Charlie?\\\\\\\" Hagrid asked Ron. \\\\\\\"I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\\\\\\\"  Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:  GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST  Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.  Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.  \\\\\\\"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\\\\\\\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.  Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.  \\\\\\\"Hagrid!\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!\\\\\\\"  There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?  As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?  \\\"\",\n          \"still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.  \\\\What's going on?\\\\\\\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.  Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.  \\\\\\\"Happy Valentine's Day!\\\\\\\" Lockhart shouted. \\\\\\\"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here!\\\\\\\"  Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.  \\\\\\\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\\\\\\\" beamed Lockhart. \\\\\\\"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!\\\\\\\"  Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look  * 236  ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.  \\\\\\\"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer.  All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.  \\\\\\\"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter!\\\\\\\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.  Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces.  \\\\\\\"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\\\\\\\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.  \\\\\\\"Not here,\\\\\\\" Harry hissed, trying to escape.  \\\\\\\"Stay still!\\\\\\\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back.  \\\\\\\"Let me go!\\\\\\\" Harry snarled, tugging.  With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.  Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.  *237*  \\\\\\\"What's going on here?\\\\\\\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.  \\\\\\\"What's all this commotion?\\\\\\\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived.  Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \\\\\\\"Here is your singing valentine:  His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,  His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord  Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.  \\\\\\\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\\\\\\\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \\\\\\\"And you, Malfoy-\\\\\\\"  Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary.  \\\\\\\"Give that back,\\\\\\\" said Harry quietly.  \\\\\\\"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, who obvi  * 238  ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.  \\\\\\\"Hand it over, Malfoy,\\\\\\\" said Percy sternly.  \\\\\\\"When I've had a look,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.  Percy said, \\\\\\\"As a school prefect -\\\\\\\" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \\\\\\\"Expelliarmus!\\\\\\\" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.  \\\\\\\"Harry!\\\\\\\" said Percy loudly. \\\\\\\"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know!\\\\\\\"  But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \\\\\\\"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!\\\\\\\"  Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.  It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else.  Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, \\\\\\\"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\\\\\\\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.  Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.  The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \\\\\\\"My name is Harry Potter.\\\\\\\"  The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.  Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written.  \\\\\\\"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\\\\\\\"  These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.  \\\\\\\"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\\\\\\\"  He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply.  \\\\\\\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.  *240*  `I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That's where I am now,\\\\\\\" Harry wrote quickly. \\\\\\\"I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\\\\\\\"  His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.  \\\\\\\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \\\\\\\"  Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.  \\\\\\\"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I can show you, if you like, \\\\\\\"came Riddle's reply. \\\\\\\"You don't have  to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \\\\\\\"  Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was   *241*  growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.  \\\\\\\"Let me show you. \\\\\\\"  Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.  (40K.55  The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.  He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.  He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.  \\\\\\\"I'm sorry,\\\\\\\" he said shakily. \\\\\\\"I didn't mean to butt in -\\\\\\\"  But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \\\\\\\"Er - I'll just go, shall I?\\\\\\\"  Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.  *242*  \\\\\\\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\\\\\\\" he half-shouted.  The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.  The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.  Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.  There was a knock on the office door.  \\\\\\\"Enter,\\\\\\\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.  A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.  \\\\\\\"Ah, Riddle,\\\\\\\" said the Headmaster.  \\\\\\\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\\\\\\\" said Riddle. He looked nervous.  \\\\\\\"Sit down,\\\\\\\" said Dippet. \\\\\\\"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.  \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.  \\\\\\\"My dear boy,\\\\\\\" said Dipper kindly, \\\\\\\"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Riddle at once. \\\\\\\"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\\\\\\\"  * 243*  \\\\\\\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\\\\\\\" said Dippet curiously.  \\\\\\\"Yes, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.  \\\\\\\"You are Muggle-born?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Half-blood, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. \\\\\\\"Muggle father, witch mother.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And are both your parents -?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\\\\\\\"  Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.  \\\\\\\"The thing is, Tom,\\\\\\\" he sighed, \\\\\\\"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\\\\\\\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.  \\\\\\\"Precisely,\\\\\\\" said the headmaster. \\\\\\\"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . .\\\\\\\"  Riddle's eyes had widened.  \\\\\\\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \\\\\\\"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle quickly.  But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \\\\\\\"no\\\\\\\" that he himself had given Dumbledore.  *244*\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. ...\\\\Out of here, quickly,\\\\\\\" said Snape.He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Petrificus Totalus!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase.\\u00a0Terror tore at Harry;s heart. ... He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow the two things were linked. ... He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. ... Dumbledore could not have died. ...He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, \\\\\\\"It's over, time to go!\\\\\\\" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -\\\\\\\"Petrificus Totalus!\\\\\\\"Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: \\\\\\\"Crucio - Crucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Impedimenta!\\\\\\\" yelled Harry.His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window -\\\\\\\"Harry, where did you come from?\\\\\\\" Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape -\\\\\\\"Take that!\\\\\\\" shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor. \\\\\\\"Neville, are you - ?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"M'all right,\\\\\\\" muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, \\\\\\\"Harry . . . Snape 'n' Malfoy . . . ran past. . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I know, I'm on it!\\\\\\\" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.\\\\\\\"Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -\\\\\\\" began Ernie Macmillan.\\\\\\\"Out of the way!\\\\\\\" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy. ...The cold night air ripped at Harry's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse -Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not Hagrid too . . .Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .\\\\\\\"Impedimenta!\\\\\\\" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate -Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape's back, and yelled, \\\\\\\"Stupefy!\\\\\\\"He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape's head; Snape shouted, \\\\\\\"Run, Draco!\\\\\\\"and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.\\\\\\\"Cruc - \\\\\\\"But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, \\\\\\\"Incendio!\\\\\\\" Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire.\\\\\\\"Fang's in there, yer evil - !\\\\\\\" Hagrid bellowed.\\\\\\\"Cruc -\\\\\\\" yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.\\\\\\\"No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!\\\\\\\" he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. \\\\\\\"You haven't got the nerve or the ability -\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Incarc-\\\\\\\"Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.\\\\\\\"Fight back!\\\\\\\" Harry screamed at him. \\\\\\\"Fight back, you cowardly-----\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Coward, did you call me, Potter?\\\\\\\" shouted Snape. \\\\\\\"Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Stupe-\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!\\\\\\\" sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. \\\\\\\"Now come!\\\\\\\" he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. \\\\\\\"It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Impedi -\\\\\\\"But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness -\\\\\\\"No!\\\\\\\" roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, \\\\\\\"Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!\\\\\\\"And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself -\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sectum - \\\\\\\"Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -\\\\\\\"No, Potter!\\\\\\\" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\\\\ this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.\\\\\\\"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no\\\\\\\"Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.\\\\\\\"Kill me then,\\\\\\\" panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. \\\\\\\"Kill me like you killed him, you coward -\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"DON'T -\\\\\\\" screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - \\\\\\\"CALL ME COWARD!\\\\\\\"And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries.\\\\\\\"Hagrid,\\\\\\\" muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \\\\\\\"HAGRID?\\\\\\\"He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.\\\\\\\"Yeh all righ', Harry? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..\\\\\\\"Hagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.\\\\\\\"I'm all right,\\\\\\\" panted Harry. \\\\\\\"Are you?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me.\\\\\\\"Hagrid put his hands under Harry's arms and raised him up with such force that Harry's feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.\\\\\\\"We should put out your house,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"the charm's 'Aguamenti' ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Knew it was summat like that,\\\\\\\" mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, \\\\\\\"Aguamenti!\\\\\\\"A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \\\\\\\"Aguamenti\\\\\\\" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\\\\\\\"S'not too bad,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \\\\\\\"Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ' . . .\\\\\\\"Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.\\\\\\\"Hagrid ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. \\\\\\\"They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hagrid . . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But what happened, Harry? I jus' saw them Death Eaters run-nin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with 'em? Where's he gone - was he chasin' them?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He . . .\\\\\\\" Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. \\\\\\\"Hagrid, he killed . . .\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Killed?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. \\\\\\\"Snape killed? What're yeh on abou', Harry?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Snape killed .. . Dumbledore.\\\\\\\"Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.\\\\\\\"Dumbledore wha, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He's dead. Snape killed him....\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Don' say that,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid roughly. \\\\\\\"Snape kill Dumbledore - don' be stupid, Harry. Wha's made yeh say tha'?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I saw it happen.\\\\\\\" , ,..\\\\\\\"Yeh couldn' have.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I saw it, Hagrid.\\\\\\\"Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ...\\\\\\\"What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,\\\\\\\" Hagrid said confidently. \\\\\\\"I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. ...\\\\\\\"Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thoughtDumbledore's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.\\\\\\\"What're they all lookin' at?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \\\\\\\"Wha's that lyin' on the grass?\\\\\\\" Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. \\\\\\\"See it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?\\\\\\\"Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.Harry heard Hagrid's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.Dumbledore's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help-----The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong-----He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:\\u00a0To the Dark LordI now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.\\u00a0I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.R.A.B.\\u00a0Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 11,\n        \"min\": 8,\n        \"max\": 37,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8,\n          14,\n          28\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCountText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCloudText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WordCount\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 871,\n        \"min\": 1552,\n        \"max\": 3823,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3064,\n          2378,\n          3549\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
